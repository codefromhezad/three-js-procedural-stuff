# Planet

Yet another experimentation around THREE.js

Right now, it renders a rotating sphere with an Earth texture. This will probably change in the future since the original idea was to tinker with shaders and procedural texture generation.

Anyway, I will definitely forget to update this README with the next changes so .. erm .. Yeah.
